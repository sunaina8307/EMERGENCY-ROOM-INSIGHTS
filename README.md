📊 Hospital Emergency Analysis
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing key performance metrics from a hospital emergency room (ER). It offers data-driven insights into patient trends, wait times, satisfaction levels, referrals, and more, helping hospital management optimize ER operations.
🧠 Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Understand daily and monthly trends in ER performance

Identify bottlenecks like long wait times

Monitor patient satisfaction and referral patterns

Provide insights into patient demographics

Enable better resource allocation for departments

🛠 Tools Used
Power BI – For data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and report building

DAX – For calculated fields and KPIs

MS Excel / CSV – (Assumed source format) for raw data

📁 Project Steps
1. 📋 Requirement Gathering
Identified key metrics needed by hospital stakeholders:

Total patients

Wait time

Satisfaction score

Referrals

Patient demographics

2. 🔍 Data Understanding
Reviewed raw data to understand structure

Identified columns relevant for KPIs

3. 🔗 Data Connection
Connected Power BI to the data source (Excel/CSV)

4. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Handled missing values

Ensured correct data types (e.g., date, number)

Removed duplicates

5. 📐 Data Modeling
Created relationships between tables

Used Date table for time-based analysis

6. ⚙️ DAX Calculations
Created measures for:

Total Patients

Average Wait Time

Patient Satisfaction Score

Patients Referred per Department

Timeliness (patients attended in <30 min)

7. 📊 Visualization & Report Design
Used cards, charts, and sparklines to display:

Daily trends (Total patients, Wait time, Satisfaction)

Monthly summaries

Age, gender, race distributions

Referrals to departments

Timeliness and peak hour analysis

8. 🔍 Insights Generated
Identified peak ER traffic days

Found correlation between long wait times and low satisfaction

Highlighted departments receiving maximum referrals

Tracked gender and race patterns

Pinpointed bottlenecks in patient handling time

📈 Key Visuals in Power BI
Area sparklines (Daily trend for patients, wait time, satisfaction)

Bar charts (Gender, Race, Referrals)

Pie charts (Admission Status, Age Groups)

Time analysis (Day and Hour-wise volume)

KPI cards (Total Patients, Avg Wait Time, Satisfaction Score)

📌 Conclusion
This Power BI project provides a data-backed view of ER operations. By visualizing patient flow, satisfaction, and service efficiency, hospital teams can make smarter decisions, improve patient care, and manage resources effectively.
